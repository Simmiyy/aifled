Smoothwall InterfaceLED README file.


What is it?
-----------
Smoothwall InterfaceLED is based on InterfaceLED (ifled), a program 
that uses the keybord LEDs to indicated various
things about a specified interface, ie, if a network card is sending
or receiving data.
sifled has some functionality specifically for use with Smoothwall
(www.smoothwall.org), namely to allow one of the LEDs to indicate
the status of the Smoothwall RED interface (ie, up or down).

See http://martybugs.net/smoothwall/leds.cgi for more information.


How do i install it?
--------------------
Put it into /usr/local/bin, /usr/sbin or some other directory.
To make it automatically start whenever your Smoothwall box reboots, add
a line to the end of your /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit to start sifled.
ie, 
/usr/local/bin/sifled console ppp0 -c ltr -f


How do i use it?
----------------
Just run "sifled [tty here] [interface here]" to use the default settings.
Use "console" as tty to use the current tty, as interface use the interface you
would like to monitor eg: eth0, ppp0. To run the ifled in background add -f to
the command line.

Example command:
sifled console eth0 -f


How do i config the LEDs? / How do i get ifled not to touch my num-lock etc?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look in the list of options from the help (start ifled with no arguments).
For exmaple "-c crt" will make num-lock indicate collisions, caps-lock indicate
receiveing of data and scroll-lock indicate transmitting of data.

A popular LED config is "-c nna" this will make num-lock and caps-lock work as
normal (hopefully) and scroll-lock indicate activity (the interface is
receiving or transmitting data)

Note: You can't use arguments like "-ic nna", use "-i -c nna" insted. 


How do i get the none option to work in console?
------------------------------------------------
If you can't use your (num,caps,scroll)-lock as normal when you use the none
option on them, try the "-a" option it may work.


The keybord is weird, keys get stuck etc
----------------------------------------
Try to increase the LED update delay by use the -d parameter. 100ms should
solve the problem, if not try to increase even more. Note that the LEDs will
flash slower at higher LED update delays.


How to i monitor more then one interface?
-----------------------------------------
Use the "n" option with the "-c" parameter for example:

./sifled console ppp0 -c nla -f  // Caps-lock will indicate status of Smoothwall RED interface 
                                // and Scroll-lock will flash on activity on ppp0
./sifled console eth0 -c ann -f  // Num-lock will flash on activity on eth0


The terminal LEDs gets fu*ked up after i have run ifled
-------------------------------------------------------
Type the command "reset" to do a terminal initialization.
Note that you'll probably have to login to your Smoothwall console to do this,
as I haven't had much success running this through a SSH connection.
